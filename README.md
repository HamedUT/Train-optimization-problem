This is a non-linear prgoramming approach to the problem stated in the paper "Cooperative Eco-Driving of Multi-Train Under dc Traction Network" with a little twist: Velocity optimization.
The code is in Pyomo and it is discritized in time. The variables, constraints, and objective function can be found at .HEIC file.
